## Random Notes (Please ignore them!)

secrets environmental variables api keys on vercel too

talk about pythonanywhere

talk about vercel.json

talk about the webhook url with the additional webhook at the back?

talk about the differences in cdoes between the long polling and webhook code and rmb to add the long polling code in this repo too

talk about the weird ubllib thing and conflict with the telegram bot library, so I just chatgpt to get a suitable versions for both for the project to work
