# 26.-CodeBuddy
This Github repository is hosting the Telegram Bot for CodeBuddy, for my submission for the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/) hackathon titled: '[RAG 'n' ROLL Amp up Search with Snowflake & Mistral Hackathon](https://snowflake-mistral-rag.devpost.com/)'. 

See the full explanation for the purpose of this Github repository in the main submission Github repository of CodeBuddy for the [RAG 'n' ROLL Amp up Search with Snowflake & Mistral Hackathon](https://snowflake-mistral-rag.devpost.com/) [here](https://github.com/WindJammer6/27.-CodeBuddy-Streamlit-Website).

## Random Notes (Please ignore them!)

secrets environmental variables api keys on vercel too

talk about pythonanywhere

talk about vercel.json

talk about the webhook url with the additional webhook at the back?

talk about the differences in cdoes between the long polling and webhook code and rmb to add the long polling code in this repo too

talk about the weird ubllib thing and conflict with the telegram bot library, so I just chatgpt to get a suitable versions for both for the project to work


managing the vercel app (only accessible by me): https://vercel.com/windjammer6s-projects/26-code-buddy


Maybe can put the visualisation explanation used the make the viddo as an image in the readme for the RAG with Snowflake cortex search and Mistral llm in codebuddy streamlit website (maybe use ClaudeAI?)

Can advertise the project differently, but taking from the old urop project and changing it with that architecture of RAG (but say that the code dosent work tho unfortunately this is just what i have so far in the new repo so dont have to destroy it???)

So the focus is to show I can understand and handle more complex AI architectures such as RAG! (For resume)
